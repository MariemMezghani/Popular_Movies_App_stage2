## Overview
This project is created for my Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. 
The app allows its users to discover the most popular movies playing. It fetches data from the internet with theMovieDB API.

## App features
- discover the most popular or the highest rated movies
- view and play trailers (either in youtube or a web browser)
- read reviews of a selected movie
- allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (heart)

## Running the app
This app utilizes the Movie Database API. To run this app, you must obtain a free API key from the MovieDB website and insert it in the NetworkUtils.java file where it says <your_api_key>.
